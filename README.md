## 📌 Overview

DisasTeller is an agentic, multi-LVLM (Large Vision-Language Model) framework for **automating key tasks in post-disaster response**, including on-site damage assessment, emergency alert generation, resource allocation, and recovery planning. The framework coordinates multiple specialised LVLM agents, with GPT-4o or Gemma3 at its core, to accelerate the disaster response workflow and structure information flow more efficiently than manual coordination. DisasTeller is intended to complement expert teams by rapidly organising visual and textual information, generating structured reports, and reducing human execution time for coordinated response activities.

## 🔁 Reproducibility and Evaluation Setup

To evaluate the reproducibility of DisasTeller in executing predefined tasks and generating structured reports for post-disaster response, we conducted five independent runs using two representative LVLM backbones: GPT-4o (`gpt-4o-2024-08-06`) and Google’s open-source Gemma3-27B.

All experiments were performed on a high-performance workstation equipped with an NVIDIA A100 (80 GB) GPU and an Intel Xeon Platinum 8352V CPU. This setup was used consistently across runs to assess the stability and repeatability of the multi-agent workflow under identical task configurations.
